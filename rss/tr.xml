3. Once your video is playing, slide our App from the bottom to the top, the player will be in floating mode! you will be able to watch your videos and simultaneously use your device in any other App :) [Check in our preview images].

• Once the producer is in floating mode, you can move it by sliding it, or make it smaller by double tapping.


PLAYBACK WITH LOCKED SCREEN:
This functionality allows you to continue listening to the audio of your videos while your device is on the locked screen, ideal for listening to your music or your favorite songs while driving, or simply when you want to rest with the audio in the background.
