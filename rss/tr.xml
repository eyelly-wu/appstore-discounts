  Protect Your Privacy with Safety Photo+Video
Your private photos and videos deserve the ultimate protection. With Safety Photo+Video, you can secure your sensitive media from prying eyes, unwanted access, and even unauthorized usage for AI machine learning purposes. Our app is designed with your privacy in mind, ensuring your personal memories stay private and under your control.

Why Choose Safety Photo+Video?
Have you ever lent your phone to someone only to worry about them snooping through your gallery? Or wondered if your private media could be used by apps or companies for AI training? With Safety Photo+Video, you can rest assured that your photos and videos remain yours alone. Our app keeps your data secure on your device and in the cloud with advanced encryption and privacy-focused technology.

Top Features You’ll Love:
• Biometric Security: Unlock the app using Touch ID or Face ID.
• Intruder Alert with AI: Capture photos of intruders trying to access your app.
• Decoy Password: Mask your real data with a decoy password option.
• Customizable Passcodes: Choose from PIN, combination lock, or dot pattern lock for added security.
• Lock Individual Albums: Assign unique passcodes to specific albums for layered protection.
• Secure Cloud Backup: Safeguard your media with encrypted cloud storage, ensuring you never lose your files while maintaining complete control.

Why Safety Photo+Video Stands Out:
With cutting-edge security and AI-powered features, Safety Photo+Video ensures your private memories are protected at all times. Whether you’re safeguarding personal moments, sensitive documents, or simply keeping nosy friends at bay, this app provides unmatched privacy.

Unlike other apps, Safety Photo+Video never uploads or uses your photos and videos for any machine learning or AI purposes. Our secure cloud backup ensures your media stays safe, encrypted, and completely under your control, so you can access it anytime, anywhere.

</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  Imagine that the entire globe is at your fingertips. Never before has getting weather information been as exciting and interactive as it is in the “Weather Now” application.
Amazingly beautiful 3D images of our planet draws your attention for so long that you may forget that the application has other useful features that allows you easy access to precise, global weather information.

The main features of “Weather Now” are the “home screen” and the forecast page with a unique way of scaling the charts. On the “home screen”, you can get information on the selected location such as local time and current weather with detailed weather conditions, and, of course, an incredibly beautiful three-dimensional image of the globe with realistic-looking atmosphere, the sun and the stars. You can manually turn it, increase and decrease its size, run the slow spinning animation or stop it. Installed in a cradle or dock station, the application can run as a screensaver, attracting your friends and fellows.

The weather forecast is provided by CustomWeather, Inc, an American weather provider of global weather information for over 11 years. CustomWeather is a leader in technology and meteorological innovation, providing local weather information to companies and application developers around the world.

Current weather data is refreshed every 30 minutes; that is twice as frequent as most other weather providers can offer. Unique 48-hour forecasts from over 80,000 locations around the world provide a level of coverage and detail that simply cannot be found elsewhere.

Current weather information includes: description, air temperature, wind direction and force, humidity, dew point, pressure, visibility, as well as comfort index with reference to current weather conditions. 
Detailed weather forecast information includes: description, day and night air temperature, wind direction and force, humidity, UV index, probability of precipitation, and comfort index with reference to current weather conditions.
