  Protect Your Privacy with Safety Photo+Video
Your private photos and videos deserve the ultimate protection. With Safety Photo+Video, you can secure your sensitive media from prying eyes, unwanted access, and even unauthorized usage for AI machine learning purposes. Our app is designed with your privacy in mind, ensuring your personal memories stay private and under your control.

Why Choose Safety Photo+Video?
Have you ever lent your phone to someone only to worry about them snooping through your gallery? Or wondered if your private media could be used by apps or companies for AI training? With Safety Photo+Video, you can rest assured that your photos and videos remain yours alone. Our app keeps your data secure on your device and in the cloud with advanced encryption and privacy-focused technology.

Top Features You’ll Love:
• Biometric Security: Unlock the app using Touch ID or Face ID.
• Intruder Alert with AI: Capture photos of intruders trying to access your app.
• Decoy Password: Mask your real data with a decoy password option.
• Customizable Passcodes: Choose from PIN, combination lock, or dot pattern lock for added security.
• Lock Individual Albums: Assign unique passcodes to specific albums for layered protection.
• Secure Cloud Backup: Safeguard your media with encrypted cloud storage, ensuring you never lose your files while maintaining complete control.
• Private and Local Processing: All data remains securely on your device and encrypted, ensuring no external company or app can access it for AI or machine learning purposes.
• Organized & Accessible: Easily create and manage albums to keep your media tidy.
• PC Sync: Securely upload or download photos and videos from your PC via a web browser.
• Capture Media: Take photos or videos directly in the app without saving them to your camera roll.
• Share Securely: Transfer media via Bluetooth to other devices with Safety Photo+Video installed.
• Universal Support: Designed for iPhone and iPad with a one-time purchase.

Why Safety Photo+Video Stands Out:
With cutting-edge security and AI-powered features, Safety Photo+Video ensures your private memories are protected at all times. Whether you’re safeguarding personal moments, sensitive documents, or simply keeping nosy friends at bay, this app provides unmatched privacy.

Unlike other apps, Safety Photo+Video never uploads or uses your photos and videos for any machine learning or AI purposes. Our secure cloud backup ensures your media stays safe, encrypted, and completely under your control, so you can access it anytime, anywhere.

Download Safety Photo+Video today and experience the ultimate peace of mind with your privacy!
