</h2><h2>Application Description</h2><p>
  This app has a simple functionality: detecting the presence of spirits and capturing them. 
Once captured, it displays the Six Syllable Mantra from Eastern Buddhism as a form of protection and blessing for the user.

• This application might scare you.
• All sensors are on one page.
• A real radar to track anomalies.
• Highly accurate EMF (Electromagnetic Field) detector.
• Take photos and detect anomalies within - can be freely turned on or off.
• More detailed instructions are available in the app; simply touch the ? button to access them.

Warning:
If you are a very sensitive or easily scared individual, please consider not using this app and turning it off. Do not put yourself in danger while using this app. If you believe you are in danger, please close the app, contact someone for help, and leave the area immediately.

Disclaimer:
Please remember that we cannot guarantee the accuracy of any ghost detection since the app uses different sensors of the device, and thus it greatly depends on the terminal's precision and quality. Since supernatural activities cannot be scientifically proven, we cannot guarantee that the app communicates with real spirits. The results of this app cannot be scientifically verified.
